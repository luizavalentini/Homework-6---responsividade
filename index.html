        <h2>For <span>Creators</span></h2>
        <p class="conteudo">
          Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital
          currency system that is dependent on growing and engaging with the
          community and also their star power. They own 10-15% of the total
          value of the tokens minted.

        <h2>For <span>Holders</span></h2>
        <p class="text"> Holding social tokens allows the individual to gain access to benefits
          including unreleased content, private communities, direct access to
          celebrity, early- access to tickets and more as well as the ability to
          trade with other communities in order to gain access to more creator
          content with early token buyers being the biggest winners as the value
          of the token increases with more buyers.

          What makes <br />
          us different?

        <p>
          <strong>
            We would only launch tokens with the express permission of the
            creators.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter,
          tiktok, Instagram and YouTube with followings in the millions who we
          would be actively engaging before we go viral.
          <br />
          <br />
          We would get them on our platform and they would see the opportunity
          to create a fan driven digital economy where their digital content can
          be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the monetary
          value of their creator's currency increase significantly as they
          promote their digital currency across their channels while our native
          token holders benefit from the Weentar popularity.

        Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens
        launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with some quite
        simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to the
        cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down that even
        a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and have
        them download an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite
        person and watch their investment as is with other crypto currency
        project.
